## About✅
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with Among-us theme.
A user can play against computer or with another friend.
There are few improvements that I would like to work on in the future.

## Stretch goals✅
- Fix any bugs in the app
- Add another activity that will have inputs for users to write their name, so when they win, the winner's name will appear in the screen.
- Add more devices with more diverse screen sizes, such as tablet and pc.

## Used...✅
- Android Studio 4.1.1
- Kotlin
